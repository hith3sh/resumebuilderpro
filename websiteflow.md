  Based on my examination of the codebase, here's the complete user flow of the resume builder website:

  Main User Journey:

  1. Landing Page (/) - Marketing homepage with:
    - Hero section, social proof, services overview
    - Resume grader tool for initial engagement
    - Call-to-action buttons leading to services or login
  2. Authentication Flow:
    - Login Page (/login) - Magic link authentication via Supabase
    - Users enter email → receive magic link → click link → redirects to /profile
    - Email Confirmation: Magic links redirect to https://proresumedesigns.com/profile (from .env.example)
  3. Profile Section (/profile) - YES, there is a comprehensive profile section:
    - Personal dashboard showing user information
    - Resume Analysis Results with ATS scores and detailed reports
    - Personal Information display (name, email, phone, industry, job title, notes)
    - Uploaded Resume access with direct download links
    - Logout functionality
  4. Service Purchase Flow:
    - Users browse services → purchase → redirected to questionnaire
    - Questionnaire Page (/questionnaire) - Post-purchase data collection:
        - Personal details form
      - Resume file upload (PDF/DOC, 5MB limit)
      - Industry and job title targeting
      - Additional notes section

  Key Features:

  The website functions as a complete resume service platform with user authentication, data collection, file management, and
  progress tracking rather than just a simple resume builder tool.
