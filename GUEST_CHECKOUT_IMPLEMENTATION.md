# Guest Checkout Implementation

## Overview
This implementation allows users to purchase products without creating an account first. After successful payment, an account is automatically created with the user's email, and they receive login instructions.

## Key Components

### 1. API Layer (`src/api/GuestCheckoutApi.js`)
- `createGuestCheckout()` - Creates temporary guest order and Stripe payment intent
- `processGuestOrderCompletion()` - Handles post-payment account creation and order association
- `checkEmailExists()` - Checks if email already has an account
- Session storage management for temporary order data

### 2. UI Components
- `src/components/GuestCheckoutModal.jsx` - Modal for collecting guest details
- `src/pages/GuestCheckoutPage.jsx` - Full guest checkout flow with Stripe Elements
- `src/pages/GuestSuccessPage.jsx` - Success page with account creation confirmation

### 3. Edge Functions
- `supabase/functions/create-guest-payment-intent/` - Creates payment intent without auth
- `supabase/functions/process-guest-order/` - Creates account and associates order
- `supabase/functions/check-email-exists/` - Email existence validation

### 4. Updated Components
- `src/pages/ProductDetailPage.jsx` - Added guest checkout option alongside login
- `src/App.jsx` - Added new routes for guest checkout flow
- `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts` - Handle guest payment webhooks

## User Flow

1. **Product Page**: User sees two options - "Quick Checkout" or "Login to Purchase"
2. **Guest Details**: If Quick Checkout is selected, modal collects email, first name, last name
3. **Payment**: Guest is redirected to secure payment page with Stripe Elements
4. **Processing**: After successful payment:
   - Check if email already has an account
   - If yes: Associate order with existing account
   - If no: Create new account with random password
5. **Success**: Show confirmation with account creation details
6. **Email**: User receives welcome email with login instructions (to be implemented)

## Benefits

- **Reduced Friction**: No account creation required before purchase
- **Automatic Account Management**: Creates accounts seamlessly post-purchase
- **Existing User Handling**: Properly merges orders with existing accounts
- **Security**: Uses strong random passwords for new accounts
- **User Experience**: Clear messaging about account creation process

## Technical Features

- **Session Management**: Temporary order data stored in sessionStorage
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the flow
- **Validation**: Email and payment data validation
- **Security**: Proper authentication for Edge Functions where needed
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly checkout experience

## Database Schema Support

The existing database schema already supports the guest checkout flow:
- `orders` table can reference any user_id
- `profiles` table supports different creation methods via metadata
- Order items are properly linked to orders

## Future Enhancements

1. **Welcome Email**: Implement email service for sending login credentials
2. **Magic Link Authentication**: Option to use magic links instead of passwords
3. **Order Tracking**: Guest-specific order tracking before account creation
4. **Social Login Integration**: Allow social login during guest checkout

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Form validation for guest details
- Payment flow error handling
- Account creation edge cases
- Existing email handling
- Session storage cleanup

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Supabase project:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (in your .env file)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (for admin functions)

## Deployment Notes

1. Deploy the new Edge Functions to Supabase
2. Update Stripe webhook endpoints to handle `payment_intent.succeeded` events
3. Ensure proper CORS settings for guest checkout endpoints
4. Test the complete flow in staging environment before production
