Summary of what we've set up:

PM2 - Running your React app on port 3000
Nginx - Proxying requests to your app
Domain Configuration - Ready for new.proresumedesigns.com

Next Steps:
Configure DNS Records in your domain registrar:
Type    Name        Value              TTL
A       @           185.230.63.107     3600
A       www         185.230.63.107     3600
A       new         89.116.170.194     3600    ← ADD THIS
A       www.new     89.116.170.194     3600    ← ADD THIS



Wait for DNS propagation (5-60 minutes)
Test your domain - Once DNS propagates, visit:
