  Phase 1: Analysis & Removal

  1. Analyze current Hostinger ecommerce integration - Find all existing payment

  Phase 2: Stripe Setup & Configuration

  3. Install and configure Stripe SDK - Add Stripe React libraries
  4. Set up Stripe environment variables - Configure API keys and settings

  Phase 3: Frontend Implementation

  6. Implement Stripe embedded checkout form component - Build reusable payment
  form
  7. Update product/service pages to use Stripe payments - Replace existing
  checkout flows
  8. Update success/confirmation pages for Stripe flow - Handle payment
  confirmations

  Phase 4: Database & Tracking

  9. Create order/purchase tracking system for Stripe - Database schema for orders
  10. Update user dashboard to show Stripe purchase history - Display transaction
  history
  11. Add Stripe webhook handling for payment events - Process payment
  confirmations

  Phase 5: Testing & Documentation
